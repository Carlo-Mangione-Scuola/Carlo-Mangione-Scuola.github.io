1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,750
today we will talk about the success criterion

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,690
3.1.4 abbreviations of the guidelines

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,349
for the accessibility of the W3C

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,780
first of all what is the purpose of this criterion

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,520
the purpose of this criterion is to

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,690
ensure that users can

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,130
access the extended form of abbreviations

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,320
or have a meaning of a

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,270
word that could have various

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,129
meanings on the page are created in this way

11
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:36,190
two situations the situation a and la

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,890
quote b situation a when the

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,510
abbreviation has only one meaning

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,579
within the page to the situation

15
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,250
b when the abbreviation can have several

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,900
meanings always within the

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,750
same page later we can

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,670
we can provide explanation

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,440
for the first occurrence of the abbreviation

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,020
or for all occurrences of

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,989
abbreviations on a page in the situation

22
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,820
in b instead we can provide

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,979
expansion an explanation for all

24
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:07,510
occurrences of abbreviations on a page

25
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,049
web

26
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:11,440
so we have various techniques that have us

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,729
helped to solve this criterion

28
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,690
one of these is g 55 or il

29
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,750
link to definitions in this

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,290
technique

31
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,740
we thus create a link with the

32
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,140
word to a site, an external source, that

33
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,130
explains it, in this case, this is the

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,890
line of code in this case I put

35
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,030
the acronym afp I gave it the name

36
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,170
alphafetoprotein and the element a I put on it

37
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,119
the source of the site by going to the page

38
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:57,310
html we can see example g55 afp

39
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,369
the page exits with the explanation of

40
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:03,970
this acronym subsequently we pass

41
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,340
to the h28 technique or that of

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,240
provide definitions using

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,750
an element called abbr this

44
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,490
element requires us the title, in fact

45
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,700
for example I have put to the element

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,690
abbr

47
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,750
the text "Ex."

48
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,520
I have put it with the title example

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,160
, i.e. the extended form of the initials e

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,590
also because for www or world wilde web

51
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,620
the result is so the user is enough

52
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,790
which places the cursor

53
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,240
above the page with the abbr element and

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,830
a mini view with the content comes out

55
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,370
which gives us the extended form of the

56
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,080
abbreviation. then there is the g70 technique

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,770
that is, provide a function to search

58
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,100
an online dictionary using

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,430
simply the linko element

60
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,820
the word dictionary putting

61
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,840
the source of an external online dictionary

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,060
in this case the braid one where one

63
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,520
could search for any word and

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,710
he gets the definition later

65
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,230
there is the h 60 technique or the use

66
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,330
of a link element for linking

67
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,560
to an always external glossary in this

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,320
case we linked the "grossario.html" e

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,960
with

70
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,360
the element a we linked the page

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,340
glossary.html I created

72
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,420
externally, or now I show,

73
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,910
or this by clicking on

74
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,190
on the link ie if the glossary ball

75
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,640
that I created externally by doing

76
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,430
unlisted lists and I made a mini

77
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,660
glossary putting in two words at random

78
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,160
, then we pass to the technique which is the

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,530
G97 which

80
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,000
provides a first use of

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,820
abbreviations and

82
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,850
immediately thereafter provides an extended form of

83
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,810
an acronym in this case simply

84
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,790
after the acronym W3C I put between

85
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,430
parenthesis the extended form by writing

86
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,080
world wide web consortium

87
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,180
finally we come to the last tenga that is

88
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,570
the G62 or supply is always a

89
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,480
glossary in this case we use a

90
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,870
element a to link to the glossary that

91
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,660
this time it is inside the page

92
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,970
so to do this we put the ID

93
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,610
glossary to the ul element for the

94
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,470
list that was the glossary I have

95
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,650
copied, which was also on the page

96
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,180
glossary.html e

97
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,790
then as the link of the word glossary

98
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,280
I put the hashtag to link the ID and

99
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,160
maybe adding up you can

100
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,190
see that when one goes to click glossary there

101
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,070
leads directly to the glossary that will be

102
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,660
scattered across the page

103
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,900
web where one can go to find ea

104
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,830
see the definition of the word thus

105
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,330
[Music]

106
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,500
thanks to the realization of these 6

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,630
techniques we are

108
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,100
managed to meet the criterion of

109
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,270
success of abbreviations

110
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,540
all this however was

111
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,880
documented in this document with

112
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,160
lines of code and explanations

113
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,970
goodbye prof
